* Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C?Sir Tim is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ), a Web standards organization founded in 1994 which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential.

* Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important. The yield of a recipe is the number of portions it will produce. Yields can also be expressed as a total volume or total weight the recipe produces. An example would be a soup recipe that yields 24, 8 oz. portions which could also be stated as a yield of six quarts or a 1 ½ gallon. A weight example would be a recipe that yields 20, 4 oz. portions of taco meat or a total yield of 5 pounds.
Standard yields for the main, often higher cost, ingredients such as meat, may also take into consideration portion cost and be determined in part by calculating the cost per cooked portion.
For example, an 11 pound roast might be purchased for $17 a pound. The cooked roast is to be served in 8 ounce portions as part of a roast beef dinner. After trimming and cooking, the roast will not weigh 11 pounds, but significantly less and will thus yield fewer than 22 portions (11 pounds multiplied by 2 – figuring that a pound (16 ounces) would yield two 8 oz portions.) By running a yield test, the number of portions, cost per portion and unit weight, and the standard yield and yield percentage, can be determined. Yield testing will be discussed later in this book.
* What is the purpose of Hypertext Markup Language in Web Programming?
Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the major markup language used to display Web pages on the Internet. In other words, Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or other resources through a Web browser.
* Why do we use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in Web Programming?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an easy-to-use design language that simplifies the task of making web pages presentable. It essentially deals with the “look and feel” of a web page. Without CSS, web pages would look dull and boring. Nearly all webpages and user interfaces written with HTML use CSS.
* Explain how XML differs from HTML. 
XML is abbreviation for eXtensible Markup Language whereas HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. XML mainly focuses on transfer of data while HTML is focused on presentation of the data. XML is content driven whereas HTML is format driven. XML is Case sensitive while HTML is Case insensitive.
* What is the advantage of JSON over XML?
JSON requires less tags than XML – XML items must be wrapped in open and close tags whereas JSON you just name the tag once
Because JSON is transportation-independent, you can just bypass the XMLHttpRequest object for getting your data.
JavaScript is not just data – you can also put methods and all sorts of goodies in JSON format.
# Conclusion
this lesson is very good and i enjoy to make html.
