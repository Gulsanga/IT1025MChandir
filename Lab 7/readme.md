# Executive Summary
Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.  Raster images are made up of pixels, while vector images are formed by mathematical curves and paths.
* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 
Being comfortable with the ins and outs of both formats and how they translate when exported is an essential skill for every designer.
## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?  
Although the file may be compressed, lossless formats will be able to reconstruct the image to its original state. Lossy image formats might reduce the number of colors and unnecessary data in your image.
## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. 
GIF images can be smaller than JPG files BUT JPG compression will create a smaller image.
# Operating SystemsJPG compression will create a smaller image.
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required. 7 Layers
* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)

## Thumbnail
Upload thumbnail to github (In class work)
