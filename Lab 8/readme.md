# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
Multiplies the number by 10
Subtracts 25 from the answer
if that answer is < 0
Displays answer is negative number
Else
Displays answer is positive number or zero

Add a textbox to the chart with your name
Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder
Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)



# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
* Packet
* Packet-Switching
* IP Address
* DNS
* Protocol

Definitions to match:
* Set of rules to allow devices to communicate,  DNS
* Unit of data , Packet
* Unique identifying number , Packet-Switching
* Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address ,  IP Address
* Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com), Protocol

## Network Hardware 
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.   A switch can determine the target port for each frame and is more intelligent and efficient
* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.  By installing a networked solution with switches and routers, you can protect valuable business data. For example, routers can protect your network with a built-in firewall and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - specialized software that examines incoming data and protects against attacks.

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.  
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
Mesh topology is widely employed to extend the coverage of short-range wireless technologies such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, WirelessHART. Most mesh networks have a self-healing capability as data can be re-routed using another path if one repeater node fails, thereby enhancing robustness.
# Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!
it is good and it is diifuclt to creat and fucose on each part but i learn a lot.
