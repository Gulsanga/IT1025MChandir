# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
Information systems hardware consists of the components of digital technology that you can touch. This chapter covered the 
components that make up a personal computer, with the 
understanding that the configuration of a personal computer is very 
similar to that of any type of digital computing device.
# Hardware
## 
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?   Hard Drives and MemoryThe performance of a hard disk is very important to the overall speed of the system a slow hard disk having the potential to hinder a fast processor like no other system component and the effective speed of a hard disk is determined by a number of factors. Chief among them is the rotational speed of the platters. Disk RPM is a critical component of hard drive performance because it directly impacts the latency and the disk transfer rate.
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?  The main difference between hard drive and SSD is that the Solid State Drive does not require any physical moving parts and instead stores data using flash chips and an electric charge.
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?   More RAM means more room for your programs to do their work. The working of RAM is also linked to something that’s called as Virtual Memory. It’s beyond the scope of this very basic primer on RAM, so let’s say more RAM makes your computer speedier as it does not have to rely on virtual memory so much.
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?   A 32-bit system can access 2 32 memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory ideally, it can access more than 4 GB of RAM also. A 64-bit system can access 2 64 memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
ALU also deals with manipulation of the data and works according to the instructions of the control unit, whereas Control Unit provides instructions to the arithmetic logical unit and coordinates according to the nature of the data provided and nature of work to be performed.
## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
Components of a Computer System - Input, Process, Output. Conventional and assistive computer technologies are similar in that both employ the core concepts of input, information processing, and output (ATA, 2000). Understanding these concepts is essential to understanding how AT helps individuals with disabilities access a computer.
# Data Representation
Data representations are useful for interpreting data and identifying trends and relationships. When working with data representations, pay close attention to both the data values and the key words in the question. When matching data to a representation, check that the values are graphed accurately for all categories.
## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers .  n mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or hex) numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the common way of representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values 10 to 15.
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file).   (211)10 = (11010011)2
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work).  101010102 in decimal
17010
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work).  192 / 16 = 12
0 x 16 = 0

12 / 16 = 0.75
0.75 x 16 = C

Thus, 192 decimal converted to hex is as follows:

C0

# Conclusion
Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
A personal 
computer is made up of many components, most importantly the 
CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, removable media, and input/
output devices. Variations on the personal computer, such as the 
smartphone, were also examined. Finally, commoditization of the 
personal computer was addressed
