# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
become familiar with hardware ALU, CPU, INPUT, OUTPUT...

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memoryb 
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?   Latency and throughput are two common terms we generally use when using computer resources such as disk storage or when sending data from source to destination in a computer network.
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive? does not require any physical moving parts and instead stores data using flash chips and an electric charge.
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster? because it give us more space to thake the information and it run fater.
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? DIMM transfers 64 bits at a time and SIMM transfers 32 bits a time.

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU? The control unit (CU) is a component of the central processing unit of the computer system that controls the operations of the processor and ALU is the main part of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer system.
* ALU also deals with manipulation of the data and works according to the instructions of the control unit, whereas Control Unit provides instructions to the arithmetic logical unit and coordinates according to the nature of the data provided and nature of work to be performed.

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output?
*  output is a divece such as  a monitor, input from a device as a  keyboard, and The main unit inside the computer is the CPU.

# Data Representation
Data are units of information, often numeric, that are collected through observation
## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)
decimal is number like 231 or ten and binary is two and it is just 1 and 0 numbers and hexadecimal is  there are sixteen different digits that can appear in a single place.
# Conclusion
Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
I READ IN THIS WEEK HOW TO CONVERT decimal to binary and binary to decimal and i learn about hard driver and memory, cpu, input, output.
