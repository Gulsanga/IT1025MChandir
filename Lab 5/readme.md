# Executive Summary

# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 
The second major category of software is application software.Application software is utilized directly today to accomplish a 
specific goal such as word processing, calculations on aspreadsheet, or surfing the Internet using your favorite browser,Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. Examples include anti-malware software and programs that totally remove software you no longer want installed.
* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example. 
In order to effectively implement an ERP system in an 
organization, the organization must be ready to make a full 
commitment. All aspects of the organization are affected as old 
systems are replaced by the ERP system. In general, implementing 
an ERP system can take two to three years and cost several million 
dollars. An example of a well-known CRM package is 
Salesforce.

# Virtualization

* In addition to the chapter use the following resource:  https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works
and explain the purpose of virtualization. 
In computing, virtualization or virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.
#### Explain the following: 
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization? IT hardware management ,Data silos,Integration between development and testing environments.
* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?  Hypervisors make virtualization possible by translating requests between the physical and virtual resources.

#### Cloud computing vs. Virtualization: 
    https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization  
 
* In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization  
cloud is is a  model for enabling on demand network access to shared of configurable computing resources. Virtualization is a software  that creates separated mmultiple images of the hardware and software on the same machine.
* Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing? heterogeneous virtual switches be managed by network administrators using the well-understood command line interface to simplify adoption yet also provide more programmatic abstractions such as SNMP, XML, XMPP to enable API-based management of the network infrastructure to the Cloud OS.
 
# Conclusion
Software gives the instructions that tell the hardware what to do. 
There are two basic categories of software: operating systems and 
applications. Operating systems interface with the computer 
hardware and make system resources available
