# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/    In a RGB color space, hex #ff0000 (also known as Red) is composed of 100% red, 0% green and 0% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 0% cyan, 100% magenta, 100% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 0 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%. #ff0000 color hex could be obtained by blending #ff0000 with #ff0000. #ff0000 (or #f00) is a websafe color
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 
Color should not be the only indicator for interactive elements
## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.  The truth table is used to show the logic gate function. All the logic gates have two inputs except the NOT gate, which has only one input. When drawing a truth table, the binary values 0 and 1 are used. Every possible combination depends on the number of inputs.
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? A NAND gate (sometimes referred to by its extended name, Negated AND gate) is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output with behavior that is the opposite of an AND gate. The output of a NAND gate is true when one or more, but not all, of its inputs are false. If all of a NAND gate's inputs are true, then the output of the NAND gate is false.
* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The association is chartered under this name and it is the full legal name.
