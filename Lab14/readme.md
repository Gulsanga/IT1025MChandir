# Executive Summary
what the goal of this lab is !
Program code reuse has been a part of structured systems development and programming languages (such as COBOL) for many years, and there have been subprograms that encapsulate data. Inheritance, however, is a feature that is only found in object-oriented systems
# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a swiftly developing field with robots impacting our lives with growing intensity. It has attracted an important place in the recent years. With the help of the technologies such as machine learning (ML), we could make the technologies with the capable of promoting their own concert by deriving from the data over time.
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?When we have to search about topics first we open a search engine like google, duckduckgo, bing and other search engines.Then we right the topic on the search bar and after that they show us the websites that collect information about that topic we open the sites and read it and after that we type that information we understand.
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?We should avoid the websites that giving false information about the topic.
* What was the hardest part of doing this project?I find the most useful is that AI can improve the manufacture in the less time.
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member.
AI is a big field that have so many branches the hardest part is to collect the informations about that field of AI.
I don’t have team members so I can’t say anything about it.
# Conclusion
Include what you have learnt from this lab
I learned that Al can be the future of technology and human generation with skills.
