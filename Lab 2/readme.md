# Information System Components  

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

Hardware -Hardware is the tangible, physical portion of an information system 
– the part you can touch.
computer Computers, keyboards, disk drives, and 
flash drives are all examples of information systems hardware
Software - Software comprises the set of instructions that tell the hardware 
what to do. Software is not tangible – it cannot be touched.
Programmers create software by typing a series of instructions 
telling the hardware what to do.
Data - The third technology component is data. You can think of data as 
a collection of facts. For example, your address (street, city state, 
postal code), your phone number, and your social networking

People - n. A focus on the people 
involved in information systems is the 
next step
Process - s. A process 
is a series of steps undertaken to achieve a desired outcome or 
goal

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 
 Known as 
“client-server,” this networking architecture allowed users to log 
in to the Local Area Network (LAN) from their PC (the “client”) by 
connecting to a central computer called a “server.” The server would 
lookup permissions for each user to determine who had access to 
various resources such as printers and files.
* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?
The digital world also became a more dangerous place as virtually 
all companies connected to the Internet. Computer viruses and 
worms, once slowly propagated through the sharing of computer 
disks, could now grow with tremendous speed via the Internet. 
Software and operating systems written for a standalone world 
found it very difficult to defend against these sorts of threats
# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
In this chapter you have been introduced to the concept of 
information systems. Several definitions focused on the main 
components: technology, people, and process.
