# Information System Components  

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM
-Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a high-speed networking standard intended for supporting the voice and data communications.
ATM technology is designed for improvement the quality of service and utilization on the high-traffic networks. ATM works on the data link layer over twisted-pair cable or fiber.
ATMs use the asynchronous time-division multiplexing and encode the data into the cells (the small fixed-sized packets). ATM networks have the cells of the fixed size and no routing, so they can easier manage the bandwidth than Ethernet.
ConceptDraw DIAGRAM is a powerful network diagramming and vector drawing software that provides the Computer and Networks solution with wide set of ready-to-use predesigned vector stencils and examples to help you design the ATM Networks quick and easy.
Hardware- Hardware is the physical part of a computer, which we can touch and feel. Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse and CPU etc are the examples of hardware. There are three types of hardware such as input device, output device and storage device
Software - Sometimes abbreviated as SW and S/W, software is a collection of instructions that enable the user to interact with a computer, its hardware, or perform tasks. Without software, most computers would be useless.
Data - Data are units of information, often numeric, that are collected through observation.
People - 
Process - In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity.

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 
Client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.
* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?
GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features
# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
In this chapter you have been introduced to the concept of 
information systems. Several definitions focused on the main 
components: technology, people, and process. You saw how the business use of information systems has evolved over the years, 
from the use of large mainframe computers for number crunching, 
through the introduction of the PC and networks, all the way to 
the era of mobile computing. During each of these phases, new 
innovations in software and technology allowed businesses to 
integrate technology more deeply into their organizations.
